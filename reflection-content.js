const BRIEF_REFLECTION = `I started by talking with a few ramp workers who do the heavy lifting. Their day‑to‑day reality helped me zoom in and out to identify the rest of the stakeholders. Because they're the final users, I give them the most influence; their comfort and ability to use the solution are the main success test. If we later loop in leads, ops control, management, or the airport team, interest and influence could shift around approvals, staffing, or training. If lift‑assist tools or AI posture feedback enter the picture, regulators may move up; clinicians' injury data and insurer incentives could also rebalance priorities, while passenger impact stays mostly indirect (on‑time, damage‑free handling).`;
